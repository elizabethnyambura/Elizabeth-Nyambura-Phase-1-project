# PROJECT OVERVIEW
For this project, I will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.
## BUSINESS PROBLEM
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
### THE DATA
The data below will be used to analyze the business problem
* 1.imdb.title.basics
* 2.imdb.title.ratings
* 3.bom.movie_gross
#### DATA ANALYSIS
The analysis was carried out in five categories as follows:
* 1 relationship between genres and total gross income
* ![image 1](https://github.com/elizabethnyambura/Elizabeth-Nyambura-Phase-1-project/assets/136367890/3599e9a0-42c9-469f-b86e-caf8e7fcefc3)

* 2.Relationship between Genres and Studio
* 3.Relationship between movie Genres and the average rating
* 4.Relationship between the average rating and the gross income
* 5.Relationship between Gross income and start year
##### CONCLUSION
Action-adventure-Fantasy genres have the highest gross income while Action-Adventure -Biography have the least gross income. Therefore, it would be advisable for Microsoft to invest in Action-Adventure-Fantasy Genres. A24 studio has the highest returns in terms of total gross income and therefore, it is advisable for Microsoft to invest in the A24 studio. Adventure-Action-Sport genres and Adventure-Drama-Sci-Fi have the highest average ratings while Documentary-Sport have the lowest average ratings. However, there is no clear relationship between average rating and total gross rating and therefore this relationship should not be used for decision making on business investment. The foreign gross income is constantly higher than the domestic gross income throughout the years when a movie is released. Hence, Microsoft should focus more on exploring the international markets and produce movies with more focus on international interests.
###### RECOMMENDATIONS
Further market study is necessary to ascertain the optimal timing for releasing a movie of a particular genre. Determining whether the total gross income of a genre experiences proportional growth with increased budgets for production, development, marketing, and advertising is crucial in profit prediction based on the budget. In addition to box office earnings, studios generate revenue from various sources such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, and streaming services. Collecting data on these revenue streams and comparing them to theatrical earnings is essential for a comprehensive financial analysis and decision-making for investment purposes.
